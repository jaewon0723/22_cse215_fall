Academic integrity is important: https://github.com/zhoulaifu/22_cse215_fall#academic-integrity. 


* Exercise 1 (score = 12)

Use truth tables to determine whether the argument form below is valid

(1)

- premises: p -> q,  q
- conclusion: p


(2)

- premises: p-> q, ~p
- conclusion: ~q

(3)

- premises: p-> q, p
- conclusion: q

(4)

- premises: p-> q, ~q
- conclusion: ~p 
  


* Exercise 2 (score = 48)

Use truth tables to determine whether the argument form below is valid  

(1)

- Premises: p -> q,  ~p -> ~q
- Conclusion:  p \/ q


(2)

- Premises: p \/ q, p -> ~q, ~r -> ~p
- Conclusion: r


(3)

- Premises: p, ~q -> ~p,  ~q \/ r
- Conclusion r


(4)

- Premises: p/\q -> ~r,  p \/ ∼q,  ∼q -> p
- Conclusion: ~r


(5)

- Premises: p -> r, q -> r
- Conclusion: (p \/ q) -> r


(6)

- Premises: p -> (q \/ r),  ~q \/ ~r
- Conclusion: ∼p \ / ∼r


  
  

* Exercise 3 (score = 20)

  Check if the two statement form are equivalent, and expaian why:

  - (p -> q)/\(q -> r)/\(r -> p)
  - p /\ q /\ r



* Exercise 4 (points = 20)

Use inference rules to show the following argument is valid

Premises
- p ∨ q
- q -> r
- p ∧ s -> t
- ∼r
- ∼q → u ∧ s

Conclusion
- t
